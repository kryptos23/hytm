\begin{theorem}
\label{th:inswrite}
There exists an opaque HyTM implementation that provides uninstrumented writes, invisible reads, progressiveness
and wait-free TM-liveness such that
in its every execution $E$, every fast-path transaction $T\in \ms{txns}(E)$
accesses $O(|\Rset(T)|)$ distinct metadata base objects.

\begin{theorem}
\label{th:inswrite2}
There exists an opaque HyTM implementation that provides uninstrumented writes, invisible reads, fast-path progressiveness
and wait-free TM-liveness such that
in its every execution $E$, every fast-path transaction $T\in \ms{txns}(E)$
accesses $O(1)$ distinct metadata base objects.

\begin{theorem}
\label{th:write}
There exists an opaque HyTM implementation that provides invisible reads, progressiveness (and resp. fast-path progressiveness)
and wait-free TM-liveness such that
in its every execution $E$, every fast-path transaction $T\in \ms{txns}(E)$
accesses $O(|\Dset(T)|)$ (and resp. $(|\Wset(T)|)$ distinct metadata base objects.
