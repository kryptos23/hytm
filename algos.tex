\section{Hybrid transactional memory algorithms}
%
We provide two key observations on this model regarding the interactions of non-committed fast path transactions 
with other transactions. 
Let $E$ be any execution of a HyTM implementation $\mathcal{M}$ in
which a fast-path transaction $T_k$ is either
t-incomplete or aborted. 
Then the sequence of events $E'$ derived by removing all events of $E|k$
from $E$ is an execution  $\mathcal{M}$. Moreover: 
%Then, the following observations are implied by our model.
\begin{observation} 
\label{ob:one}
To every slow-path transaction $T_m \in \ms{txns}(E)$, $E$ is indistinguishable 
from $E'$. 
\end{observation}

% \end{figure*}
%
\begin{observation} 
\label{ob:two}
If a fast-path transaction $T_m\in \ms{txns}(E) \setminus \{T_k\}$ does not incur a tracking set abort in $E$, 
then $E$ is indistinguishable to $T_m$ from $E'$.
\end{observation}
%
Intuitively, these observations say that fast-path transactions which are not yet committed are 
invisible to slow-path transactions, and can communicate with other
fast-path transactions only by incurring their tracking-set aborts.
