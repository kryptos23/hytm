In this section, we first identify some invariants that follow from the HyTM execution model presented in the previous section.
We then describe two HyTM implementations: \cref{sec:hytm1} describes a progressive opaque TM while \cref{sec:hytm2} describes an opaque HyTM that is progressive only for read-only slow-path transactions.

Let $E$ be any execution of a HyTM implementation $\mathcal{M}$ in
which a fast-path transaction $T_k$ is either
t-incomplete or aborted. Let $E'$ be the execution fragment that is a subsequence of $E$ derived by removing all cached events of $E|k$.
%
\begin{observation} 
\label{ob:one}
To every slow-path transaction $T_m \in \ms{txns}(E)$, $E$ is indistinguishable from $E'$. Additionally, if a fast-path transaction $T_m\in \ms{txns}(E) \setminus \{T_k\}$ does not incur a tracking set abort in $E$, 
then $E$ is indistinguishable to $T_m$ from $E'$.
\end{observation}
