\section{Hybrid transactional memory algorithms}\label{sec:hytmalgos}
%
In this section, we identify some invariants that follow from the HyTM execution model presented in the previous section.
Let $E$ be any execution of a HyTM implementation $\mathcal{M}$ in
which a fast-path transaction $T_k$ is either
t-incomplete or aborted. 
%
\begin{observation} 
\label{ob:one}
Then the sequence of events $E'$ derived by removing all events of $E|k$
from $E$ is an execution of $\mathcal{M}$. Moreover: 
To every slow-path transaction $T_m \in \ms{txns}(E)$, $E$ is indistinguishable 
from $E'$.
If a fast-path transaction $T_m\in \ms{txns}(E) \setminus \{T_k\}$ does not incur a tracking set abort in $E$, 
then $E$ is indistinguishable to $T_m$ from $E'$.

\end{observation}
