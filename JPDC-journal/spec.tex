\section{Progressive HyTM must perform incremental validation}
\label{sec:lb}
%
In this section, we show that it is impossible to implement opaque \emph{progressive} HyTMs with \emph{invisible reads}
with $O$(1) step-complexity read operations for slow-path transactions. 
This result holds even if fast-path transactions may perform
direct trivial accesses.

Formally, we say that a HyTM implementation $\mathcal{M}$ is progressive
for a set $\mathcal{T}$ of transactions
if in any execution $E$ of $\mathcal{M}$; $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \ms{txns}(E)$, 
if any transaction $T_k \in \mathcal{T}$ returns $A_k$ in $E$, there exists 
another concurrent transaction $T_m$ that \emph{conflicts} (both access the same t-object and at least one writes) with $T_k$ in $E$~\cite{tm-book}.

We construct an execution of a progressive opaque HyTM in which every t-read performed by a read-only slow-path transaction
must access linear (in the size of the read set) number of distinct base objects.
%
\begin{theorem}
\label{th:impossibility}
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be any progressive opaque HyTM implementation providing invisible reads.
There exists an execution $E$ of $\mathcal{M}$ and some slow-path read-only transaction $T_k \in \ms{txns}(E)$
that incurs a time complexity of $\Omega (m^2)$; $m=|\Rset(T_k)|$.
\end{theorem}
%
\noindent\textbf{proofsketch}
	We construct an execution of a read-only slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ that performs $m \in \mathbb{N}$
	distinct t-reads of t-objects $X_1,\ldots , X_m$. We show inductively that for each 
	$i\in \{1,\ldots , m\}$; $m \in \mathbb{N}$, the $i^{\ms{th}}$ t-read must access $i-1$ distinct base objects
	during its execution. The (partial) steps in our execution are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:indis}.
	
	For each $i\in \{1,\ldots , m\}$, $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form depicted in Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-2}.
	Start with the complete step contention-free execution of slow-path read-only transaction $T_{\phi}$ that performs
	$(i-1)$ t-reads: $\Read_{\phi}(X_1)\cdots \Read_{\phi}(X_{i-1})$, followed by the t-complete step contention-free execution of a fast-path transaction $T_{i}$
	that writes $nv_i\neq v_i$ to $X_i$ and commits and then the complete step contention-free execution fragment of $T_{\phi}$ that performs its $i^{th}$ t-read:
	$\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow nv_i$. Indeed, by progressiveness, $T_i$ cannot incur tracking set aborts and since it accesses only a single t-object, it cannot incur capacity aborts.
	Moreover, in this execution, the t-read of $X_i$ by slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ must return the value $nv$ written by fast-path transaction $T_i$ since this execution is indistinguishable
	to $T_{\phi}$ from the execution in Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-1}. 
	
	We now construct $(i-1)$ different executions of the form depicted in Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-3}: for each $\ell \leq (i-1)$, 
	a fast-path transaction $T_{\ell}$ (preceding $T_i$ in real-time ordering, but invoked following the $(i-1)$ t-reads by $T_{\phi}$) writes $nv_{\ell}\neq v$ to $X_{\ell}$ and commits, followed by
	the t-read of $X_i$ by $T_{\phi}$. Observe that, $T_{\ell}$ and $T_i$ which access mutually disjoint data sets cannot contend on each other since if they did, they would concurrently contend
	on some base object and incur a tracking set abort, thus violating progressiveness.
	Indeed, by the TM-liveness property we assumed (cf. Section~\ref{sec:hytm}) and invisible reads for $T_{\phi}$, each of these $(i-1)$ executions exist. 
	
	In each of these $(i-1)$ executions, the final t-read of $X_i$ cannot return the new value $nv$:
	the only possible serialization for transactions is $T_{\ell}$, $T_i$, $T_{\phi}$; but the $\Read_{\phi}(X_{\ell})$
	performed by $T_k$ that returns the initial value $v$ is not legal in this serialization---contradiction to the assumption of opacity.
	In other words, slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ is forced to verify the validity of t-objects in $\Rset(T_{\phi})$.
	Finally, we note that, for all $\ell, \ell' \leq (i-1)$;$\ell' \neq \ell$, 
	fast-path transactions $T_{\ell}$ and $T_{\ell'}$ access mutually disjoint sets of base objects thus forcing the t-read of $X_i$ to access least $i-1$ different base objects
	in the worst case.
	Consequently, for all $i \in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ must perform at least $i-1$ steps 
	while executing the $i^{th}$ t-read in such an execution.
%\end{proofsketch}
%

The formal proof follows.
First we prove the following lemma that is a simple extension of the analogous lemma from \cite{hytm14disc}
allowing direct trivial accesses inside fast-path transactions which in turn is inspired by an analogous result concerning \emph{disjoint-access parallel} STMs~\cite{AHM09}. 
Intuitively, the proof follows follows from the fact that
the tracking set of a process executing a fast-path transaction is invalidated due to contention on a base
object with another transaction (cf. Remark~\ref{re:traborts}).
%
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lm:hytm}
	%
	Let $\mathcal{M}$ be any progressive HyTM implementation in which fast-path transactions may perform trivial
	direct accesses.
	Let $E_1 \cdot E_2$ be an execution of $\mathcal{M}$ where
	$E_1$ (and resp. $E_2$) is the step contention-free
	execution fragment of transaction $T_1$ (and resp. $T_2$) executed by process $p_1$ (and resp. $p_2$),
	$T_1$ and $T_2$ do not conflict in $E_1 \cdot E_2$, and
	at least one of $T_1$ or $T_2$ is a fast-path transaction. 
	Then, $T_1$ and $T_2$ do not contend on any base object in $E_1 \cdot E_2$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose, by contradiction that $T_1$ and $T_2$ 
	contend on the same base object in $E_1\cdot E_2$.
	%Let $p_1$ (and resp. $p_2$) be the process executing transaction $T_1$ (and resp. $T_2$).
	
	If in $E_1$, $T_1$ performs a nontrivial event on a base object on which they contend, let $e_1$ be the last
	event in $E_1$ in which $T_1$ performs such an event to some base object $b$ and $e_2$, the first event
	in $E_2$ that accesses $b$ (note that by assumption, $e_1$ is a direct access).
	Otherwise, $T_i$ only performs trivial events in $E_1$ to base objects (some of which may be direct) on which it contends with $T_{2}$ in $E_1\cdot E_2$:
	let $e_2$ be the first event in $E_2$ in which $E_2$ performs a nontrivial event to some base object $b$
	on which they contend and $e_1$, the last event of $E_1$ in $T_1$ that accesses $b$.
	
	Let $E_1'$ (and resp. $E_2'$) be the longest prefix of $E_1$ (and resp. $E_2$) that does not include
	$e_1$ (and resp. $e_2$).
	Since before accessing $b$, the execution is step contention-free for $T_1$, $E \cdot
	E_1'\cdot E_2'$ is an execution of $\mathcal{M}$.
	By assumption of lemma, $T_1$ and $T_2$ do not conflict in $E_1'\cdot E_2'$.
	By construction, $E_1 \cdot E_2'$ is indistinguishable to $T_2$ from $E_1' \cdot E_2'$.
	Hence, $T_1$ and $T_{2}$ are poised to apply contending events $e_1$ and $e_2$ on $b$ in the execution
	$\tilde E=E_1' \cdot E_2'$.
	
	We now consider two cases:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 
		($e_1$ is a nontrivial event)
		After $\tilde E\cdot e_1$, $b$ is contained in the tracking set of process
		$p_1$ in exclusive mode and in the extension $\tilde E\cdot e_1 \cdot e_2$, we have that
		$\tau_1$ is invalidated. Thus, by Remark~\ref{re:traborts}, transaction $T_1$ must return $A_1$ 
		in any extension of $E\cdot e_1\cdot e_2$---a contradiction
		to the assumption that $\mathcal{M}$ is progressive.   
		\item
		($e_1$ is a trivial event)
		Recall that $e_1$ may be potentially an event involving a direct access.
		Consider the execution $\tilde E\cdot e_2$ following which $b$ is contained in the tracking set of process
		$p_{2}$ in exclusive mode. Clearly, we have an extension $\tilde E\cdot e_2 \cdot e_1$ in which
		$\tau_{2}$ is invalidated. Thus transaction $T_{2}$ must return $A_{2}$ in any extension of $E\cdot e_2\cdot e_1$---a contradiction
		to the assumption that $\mathcal{M}$ is progressive.   
	\end{enumerate}
	%
\end{proof}

%\setcounter{0}
The proof of Theorem~\ref{th:impossibility} is presented next.
%
\begin{proof}
	For all $i\in \{1,\ldots , m\}$; $m \in \mathbb{N}$, let 
	$v$ be the initial value of t-object $X_i$.
	Let $\pi^{m}$ denote the complete step contention-free execution of a slow-path transaction
	$T_{\phi}$ that performs ${m}$ t-reads: $\Read_{\phi}(X_1)\cdots \Read_{\phi}(X_{m})$
	such that for all $i\in \{1,\ldots , m \}$, $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow v$.
	%
	\begin{claim}
		\label{cl:readdap}
		For all $i\in \mathbb{N}$, $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i\cdot \alpha^i$ where,
		%
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			$\pi^{i-1}$ is the complete step contention-free execution of slow-path read-only transaction $T_{\phi}$ that performs
			$(i-1)$ t-reads: $\Read_{\phi}(X_1)\cdots \Read_{\phi}(X_{i-1})$,
			\item
			$\rho^i$ is the t-complete step contention-free execution of a fast-path transaction $T_{i}$
			that writes $nv_i\neq v_i$ to $X_i$ and commits,
			\item
			$\alpha^i$ is the complete step contention-free execution fragment of $T_{\phi}$ that performs its $i^{th}$ t-read:
			$\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow nv_i$.
		\end{itemize}
		%
	\end{claim}
	%
	\begin{proof}
		%
		$\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$.
		Since $\Dset(T_k) \cap \Dset(T_{i}) =\emptyset$ in $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$,
		by Lemma~\ref{lm:hytm}, transactions $T_{\phi}$ and $T_i$ do not contend
		on any base object in execution $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$.
		Moreover, since they each access a single t-object, fast-path transaction $T_i$ cannot incur a capacity abort.
		Thus, $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$ is also an execution of $\mathcal{M}$.
		
		By opacity, $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1} \cdot \alpha^i$ (Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-1}) is an execution
		of $\mathcal{M}$ in which the t-read of $X_i$ performed by $T_{\phi}$ must return $nv_i$.
		But $\rho^i \cdot \pi^{i-1} \cdot \alpha^i$ is indistinguishable to $T_{\phi}$ from
		$\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha^i$.
		Thus, $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha^i$ (Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-2}).
	\end{proof}
	%
	For each $i\in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, $j\in \{1,2\}$ and $\ell \leq (i-1)$, 
	we now define an execution of the form  $\mathbb{E}_{j\ell}^{i}=\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha_j^i$
	as follows:
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		%$\rho^m$ is defined as above;
		$\beta^{\ell}$ is the t-complete step contention-free execution fragment of a fast-path transaction $T_{\ell}$
		that writes $nv_{\ell}\neq v$ to $X_{\ell}$ and commits
		\item
		$\alpha_1^i$ (and resp. $\alpha_2^i$) is the complete step contention-free execution fragment of 
		$\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow v$ (and resp. $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow A_{\phi}$).
	\end{itemize}
	%
	Note that in the execution so defined above, we assume that each fast-path transactions $T_i$ and $T_{\ell}$;$\ell \leq (i-1)$ are executed by distinct processes.
	%
	\begin{claim}
		\label{cl:ic2}
		For all $i\in \{2,\ldots, m\}$ and $\ell \leq (i-1)$, $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\mathbb{E}_{1\ell}^{i}$ or 
		$\mathbb{E}_{2\ell}^{i}$.
	\end{claim}
	%
	%The proof of the above claim is immediate.
	\begin{proof}
		%
		Note that by our assumption on capacity aborts, fast-path transactions $T_i$ and $T_{\ell}$ cannot incur capacity aborts in the defined execution.
		
		For all $i \in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, $\pi^{i-1}$
		is an execution of $\mathcal{M}$.
		By assumption of invisible reads, $T_{{\ell}}$ must be committed in $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^{\ell}$
		and $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}$.
		By the same reasoning, since $T_i$ and $T_{\ell}$ do not have conflicting data sets,
		$\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$.
		
		Since the configuration after $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$ is quiescent,
		$\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$ extended with $\Read_{\phi}(X_i)$
		must return a matching response.
		If $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow v_i$, then clearly $\mathbb{E}_{1}^{i}$
		is an execution of $M$ with $T_{\phi}, T_{i-1}, T_i$ being a valid serialization
		of transactions.
		If $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow A_{\phi}$, the same serialization
		justifies an opaque execution.
		
		Suppose by contradiction that there exists an execution of $\mathcal{M}$ such that
		$\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$ is extended with the complete execution
		of $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow r$; $r \not\in \{A_{\phi},v\}$. 
		The only plausible case to analyse is when $r=nv$.
		Since $\Read_{\phi}(X_i)$ returns the value of $X_i$ updated by $T_i$, 
		the only possible serialization for transactions is $T_{\ell}$, $T_i$, $T_{\phi}$; but $\Read_{\phi}(X_{\ell})$
		performed by $T_k$ that returns the initial value $v$
		is not legal in this serialization---contradiction.
	\end{proof}
	%
	\begin{claim}
		%
		For all $i\in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, $j\in \{1,2\}$ and $\ell \leq (i-1)$, slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ must access
		$(i-1)$ different base objects during the execution of $\Read_{\phi}(X_i)$ in the execution
		$\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha_j^i$.
	\end{claim}
	\begin{proof}
		Consider the $(i-1)$ different executions: 
		$\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{1}\cdot \rho^i$, $\ldots$, $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i$ (cf. Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-3}).
		For all $\ell, \ell' \leq (i-1)$;$\ell' \neq \ell$, 
		$\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \beta^{\ell'}$
		in which fast-path transactions $T_{\ell}$ (executed by process $p_{\ell}$) and $T_{\ell'}$ (executed by process $p_{\ell'}$) access mutually disjoint data sets.
		By invisible reads and Lemma~\ref{lm:hytm}, the pairs of transactions $T_{\ell'}$, $T_{i}$ and $T_{\ell'}$, $T_{\ell}$
		do not contend on any base object in this execution.
		This implies that $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell} \cdot \beta^{\ell'} \cdot \rho^i$ is an execution of $\mathcal{M}$ in which
		transactions $T_{\ell}$ and $T_{\ell'}$ each apply nontrivial primitives
		to mutually disjoint sets of base objects in the execution fragments $\beta^{\ell}$ and $\beta^{\ell'}$ respectively.
		
		This implies that for any $j\in \{1,2\}$, $\ell \leq (i-1)$, the configuration $C^i$ after $E^i$ differs from the configurations
		after $\mathbb{E}_{j\ell}^{i}$ only in the states of the base objects that are accessed in the fragment $\beta^{\ell}$.
		Consequently, slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ must access at least $i-1$ different base objects
		in the execution fragment $\pi_j^i$
		to distinguish configuration $C^i$ from the configurations
		that result after the $(i-1)$ different executions 
		$\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{1}\cdot \rho^i$, $\ldots$, $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i$ respectively.
	\end{proof}
	%
	Thus, for all $i \in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ must perform at least $i-1$ steps 
	while executing the $i^{th}$ t-read in the execution fragment $\pi_{j}^i$. 
	Inductively, this gives the $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m-1} i=\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ step complexity for $T_{\phi}$ thus completing the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{How STM implementations mitigate the quadratic lower bound step complexity}
NOrec~\cite{norec} is a progressive opaque STM that minimizes the average step-complexity resulting from incremental 
validation of t-reads. Transactions read a global versioned lock at the start, and perform value-based validation
during t-read operations \emph{iff} the global version has changed.
TL2~\cite{DSS06} improves over NOrec by circumventing the lower bound
of Theorem~\ref{th:impossibility}. Concretely, TL2 associates a global version with each t-object updated during
a transaction and performs validation with O(1) complexity during t-reads by simply verifying if the version
of the t-object is greater than the global version read at the start of the transaction. Technically,
NOrec and algorithms in this paper provide a stronger definition of progressiveness: a transaction may abort
only if there is a prefix in which it conflicts with another transaction and both are t-incomplete. TL2 on the other hand allows
a transaction to abort due to a concurrent conflicting transaction.

\subsection{Implications for disjoint-access parallelism in HyTM}
The property of disjoint-access parallelism (DAP), in its \emph{weakest} form, ensures that two transactions %$T_1$ and $T_2$
concurrently contend on the same base object 
%(both access the base object and at least one updates it) 
only if their data 
sets are connected in the \emph{conflict graph}, capturing 
data-set overlaps among all concurrent transactions~\cite{AHM09}. It is well known that weak DAP STMs with invisible reads must perform incremental validation even if the required TM-progress condition requires
transactions to commit only in the absence of any concurrent transaction~\cite{tm-book,prog15-pact}. For example, DSTM~\cite{HLM+03} is a weak DAP STM that is progressive and consequently incurs the validation
complexity. On the other hand, TL2 and NOrec are not weak DAP since they employ a global versioned lock that mitigates the cost of incremental validation, but this allows two transactions accessing
disjoint data sets to concurrently contend on the same memory location. Indeed, this inspires the proof of Theorem~\ref{th:impossibility}.
