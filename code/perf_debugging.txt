seems like huge false sharing on hybrid norec... it gets 33% slower when we disable papi... seemingly random layout changes... on gsl?

why is hybrid norec faster with RQs than without? (most approaches have this property...)
    where are hybridnorec's l3 cache misses coming from?
    
    WITH RQ:
    25% ebr         -- 12% announcement checking, more on checked[], more on epoch... false sharing?
    16% counters    -- false sharing?
    7% txload       -- mostly gsl... false sharing?
    20% kernel   (WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM???)

    WITHOUT RQ (more l3 miss -- more cycles, same instr, negligible rq throughput):
    47% ebr         -- epoch, then checked, then announcement
    11% counters
    8% rng          -- false sharing?
    5% txload       -- half gsl
    15% kernel
    
    really seems like huge false sharing issues!!!
