[seems like huge false sharing on hybrid norec... it gets 33% slower when we disable papi... seemingly random layout changes... on gsl?]

[why is hybrid norec faster with RQs than without? (other TMs show this anomaly as well...)]
    FEWER l3 misses with RQs? where are hybridnorec's cache misses coming from?
    
    WITH RQ:
    25% ebr alg     -- 12% announcement checking, more on checked[], more on epoch... false sharing?
    16% counters    -- false sharing?
    7% txload       -- mostly gsl... false sharing?
    20% kernel   (WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM???)

    WITHOUT RQ (more l3 miss -- more cycles, same instr, negligible rq throughput):
    47% ebr         -- epoch, then checked, then announcement
    11% counters
    8% rng          -- false sharing?
    5% txload       -- half gsl
    15% kernel
    
    really seems like huge false sharing issues!!!
    
[why do cluster/scatter often look similar??]

----- can write in paper about methodological issues, need for padding --- huge perf swings and effects (and whatever else we find is a real issue / fix...)
