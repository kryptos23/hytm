- adjust initial read/write set sizes
    affects perf a fair bit --- especially causing huge memsets with avx...
    apparently even during measured parts of experiments???

- interaction between avx_memsets and hardware tm?

- very different TxLoad_stm costs for inserts vs erase/find???
    exposed with command:
        ./compile_x64.sh && BIN="zyra.dsbench_hytm2" ; ARGS="-t 10000 -mr debra -ma new -mp none -p -k 10000 -i 20 -d 20 -rq 0 -rqsize 256 -nwork 36 -nrq 0" ; LD_PRELOAD=../../lib/libjemalloc.so numactl --interleave=all perf record -F 999 -D 5000 -g ../bin/$BIN $ARGS && flamegraph "$BIN $ARGS"

    - possibly integrate GSTATS to get a better sense of what, e.g.,
        read/write set size is in insert/erase (histogram?)
        - after some investigation it seems to make some sense...
            insert fails more because it's ALWAYS a write-transaction... unlike erase.

- try flame graphs with dwarf
    seems a bit sketchier...
