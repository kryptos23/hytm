\paragraph{HyTM complexity bounds.}
The proof of Theorem~\ref{th:impossibility} is heavily based on the analogous proof for step complexity of
STMs that are \emph{disjoint-access parallel} from \cite{prog15-pact}.
The model from \cref{sec:hytm} itself is an extension of the HyTM model introduced in \cite{hytm14disc}
which does not allow uncached accesses within the fast-path.

\paragraph{HyTM algorithms.}
