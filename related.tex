%\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{HyTM complexity.}
The proof of Theorem~\ref{th:impossibility} is based on the analogous proof for step complexity of STMs that are \emph{disjoint-access parallel}~\cite{prog15-pact}.
%Our model extends the HyTM model in \cite{hytm14disc} which did not allow uncached accesses on the fast-path.
%\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{HyTM implementations.}
% An early HyTM implementation described in \cite{damronhytm} uses the \emph{ROCK} processor~\cite{rock} as the underlying HTM
% while \cite{kumarhytm} described an implementation that requires support for \emph{non-cached accesses} in a hardware transaction. 
Early HyTMs like the ones described in \cite{damronhytm, kumarhytm} provided progressiveness, but
subsequent HyTM proposals sacrificed progressiveness for lesser instrumentation overheads.
Recent work has investigated fallback to \emph{reduced} hardware transactions~\cite{MS13}
in which an all-software slow-path is replaced by a mix of hardware and software transactions. 
% Afek \emph{et al}. proposed amalgamated lock elision (ALE)~\cite{ale15} which improves over TLE
% by executing the slow-path as a series of segments, each of which is a dynamic length hardware transaction.
Our implementation of Hybrid NOrec follows \cite{hynorecriegel}, which additionally proposed the use of non-speculative accesses
in fast-path transactions to reduce instrumentation overhead. %(supported in the AMD ASF architectures).

%\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Concluding remarks.}
In ongoing work, we are implementing our algorithms on the IBM POWER8 HTM implementation which supports
non-cached accesses in hardware transactions.
We hope to understand whether the instrumentation overheads we observed
on Intel's HTM are also inherent to POWER8's HTM implementation.

To our knowledge, ours is the first work to consider the theoretical foundations of the cost of concurrency in HyTMs.
In order to achieve high performance in practice, one must either identify a new progress condition to replace progressiveness or develop a new HyTM algorithm that effectively uses non-speculative writes.
Both directions are promising, and little work has been done in either in the context of today's HTMs.
