In this section, we show that it is impossible to implement opaque \emph{progressive} HyTMs with \emph{invisible reads}
with $O$(1) step-complexity read operations for slow-path transactions. 
This result holds even if fast-path transactions may perform
direct trivial accesses.

Formally, we say that a HyTM implementation $\mathcal{M}$ is progressive
for a set $\mathcal{T}$ of transactions
if in any execution $E$ of $\mathcal{M}$; $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \ms{txns}(E)$, 
if any transaction $T_k \in \mathcal{T}$ returns $A_k$ in $E$, there exists 
another concurrent transaction $T_m$ that \emph{conflicts} (both access the same t-object and at least one writes) with $T_k$ in $E$.
%
\begin{theorem}
\label{th:impossibility}
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be any progressive opaque HyTM implementation providing invisible reads.
There exists an execution $E$ of $\mathcal{M}$ and some slow-path read-only transaction $T_k \in \ms{txns}(E)$
that incurs a time complexity of $\Omega (m^2)$; $m=|\Rset(T_k)|$.
\end{theorem}
%
For the proof, we construct an execution of a read-only slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ that performs $m \in \mathbb{N}$
distinct t-reads of t-objects $X_1,\ldots , X_m$. We show inductively that for each 
$i\in \{1,\ldots , m\}$; $m \in \mathbb{N}$, the $i^{\ms{th}}$ t-read must access $i-1$ distinct base objects
during its execution. The (partial) steps in our execution are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:indis}.

\paragraph{How STM implementations avoid the lower bound.}
NOrec~\cite{norec} is a progressive opaque STM that minimizes the average step-complexity resulting from incremental 
validation of t-reads. Transactions read a global versioned lock at the start, and perform value-based validation
during t-read operations \emph{iff} the global version has changed.
\emph{TL2}~\cite{DSS06} improves over NOrec by circumventing the lower bound
of Theorem~\ref{th:impossibility}. Concretely, TL2 associates a global version with each t-object updated during
a transaction and performs validation with $O$(1) complexity during t-reads by simply verifying if the version
of the t-object is greater than the global version read at the start of the transaction. Technically,
NOrec and algorithms in this paper provide a stronger definition of progressiveness: a transaction may abort
only if there is a prefix in which it conflicts with another transaction and both are t-incomplete. TL2 on the other hand allows
a transaction to abort due to a concurrent conflicting transaction.

The formal proof follows.
%
\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:hytm}
%
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be any progressive HyTM implementation in which fast-path transactions may perform trivial
direct accesses.
Let $E_1 \cdot E_2$ be an execution of $\mathcal{M}$ where
$E_1$ (and resp. $E_2$) is the step contention-free
execution fragment of fast-path transaction $T_1$ (and resp. $T_2$),
$T_1$ and $T_2$ do not conflict in $E_1 \cdot E_2$, and
at least one of $T_1$ or $T_2$ is a fast-path transaction. 
Then, $T_1$ and $T_2$ do not contend on any base object in $E_1 \cdot E_2$.
\end{lemma}
%
% \begin{proof}
% %
% Suppose, by contradiction that $T_1$ and $T_2$ 
% contend on the same base object in $E_1\cdot E_2$.
% Let $p_1$ (and resp. $p_2$) be the process executing transaction $T_1$ (and resp. $T_2$).
% 
% If in $E_1$, $T_1$ performs a nontrivial event on a base object on which they contend, let $e_1$ be the last
% event in $E_1$ in which $T_1$ performs such an event to some base object $b$ and $e_2$, the first event
% in $E_2$ that accesses $b$ (note that by assumption, $e_1$ is a cached access).
% Otherwise, $T_i$ only performs trivial events in $E_1$ to base objects (some of which may be uncached) on which it contends with $T_{2}$ in $E_1\cdot E_2$:
% let $e_2$ be the first event in $E_2$ in which $E_2$ performs a nontrivial event to some base object $b$
% on which they contend and $e_1$, the last event of $E_1$ in $T_1$ that accesses $b$ (possibly uncached).
% 
% Let $E_1'$ (and resp. $E_2'$) be the longest prefix of $E_1$ (and resp. $E_2$) that does not include
% $e_1$ (and resp. $e_2$).
% Since before accessing $b$, the execution is step contention-free for $T_1$, $E \cdot
% E_1'\cdot E_2'$ is an execution of $\mathcal{M}$.
% By assumption of lemma, $T_1$ and $T_2$ do not conflict in $E_1'\cdot E_2'$.
% By construction, $E_1 \cdot E_2'$ is indistinguishable to $T_2$ from $E_1' \cdot E_2'$.
% Hence, $T_1$ and $T_{2}$ are poised to apply contending events $e_1$ and $e_2$ on $b$ in the execution
% $\tilde E=E_1' \cdot E_2'$.
% 
% We now consider two cases:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item 
% ($e_1$ is a nontrivial event)
% After $\tilde E\cdot e_1$, $b$ is contained in the tracking set of process
% $p_1$ in exclusive mode and in the extension $\tilde E\cdot e_1 \cdot e_2$, we have that
% $\tau_1$ is invalidated. Thus, by Observation~\ref{ob:traborts}, transaction $T_1$ must return $A_1$ 
% in any extension of $E\cdot e_1\cdot e_2$---a contradiction
% to the assumption that $\mathcal{M}$ is progressive.   
% \item
% ($e_1$ is a trivial event)
% Recall that $e_1$ may be potentially uncached.
% Consider the execution $\tilde E\cdot e_2$ following which $b$ is contained in the tracking set of process
% $p_{2}$ in exclusive mode. Clearly, we have an extension $\tilde E\cdot e_2 \cdot e_1$ in which
% $\tau_{2}$ is invalidated. Thus transaction $T_{2}$ must return $A_{2}$ in any extension of $E\cdot e_2\cdot e_1$---a contradiction
% to the assumption that $\mathcal{M}$ is progressive.   
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{proof}
%
\begin{proof}
We construct an execution of a progressive opaque HyTM in which every t-read performed by a read-only slow-path transaction
must access linear (in the size of the read set) number of distinct base objects.

For all $i\in \{1,\ldots , m\}$; $m \in \mathbb{N}$, let 
$v$ be the initial value of t-object $X_i$.
Let $\pi^{m}$ denote the complete step contention-free execution of a slow-path transaction
$T_{\phi}$ that performs ${m}$ t-reads: $\Read_{\phi}(X_1)\cdots \Read_{\phi}(X_{m})$
such that for all $i\in \{1,\ldots , m \}$, $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow v$.
%
\begin{claim}
\label{cl:readdap}
For all $i\in \mathbb{N}$, $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i\cdot \alpha^i$ where,
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\pi^{i-1}$ is the complete step contention-free execution of slow-path read-only transaction $T_{\phi}$ that performs
$(i-1)$ t-reads: $\Read_{\phi}(X_1)\cdots \Read_{\phi}(X_{i-1})$,
\item
$\rho^i$ is the t-complete step contention-free execution of a fast-path transaction $T_{i}$
that writes $nv_i\neq v_i$ to $X_i$ and commits,
\item
$\alpha^i$ is the complete step contention-free execution fragment of $T_{\phi}$ that performs its $i^{th}$ t-read:
$\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow nv_i$.
\end{itemize}
%
\end{claim}
%
\begin{proof}
%
$\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$.
Since $\Dset(T_k) \cap \Dset(T_{i}) =\emptyset$ in $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$,
by Lemma~\ref{lm:hytm}, transactions $T_{\phi}$ and $T_i$ do not contend
on any base object in execution $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$.
Thus, $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1}$ is also an execution of $\mathcal{M}$.

By opacity, $\rho^i\cdot \pi^{i-1} \cdot \alpha^i$ (Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-1}) is an execution
of $\mathcal{M}$ in which the t-read of $X_i$ performed by $T_{\phi}$ must return $nv_i$.
But $\rho^i \cdot \pi^{i-1} \cdot \alpha^i$ is indistinguishable to $T_{\phi}$ from
$\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha^i$.
Thus, $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha^i$ (Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-2}).
\end{proof}
%
For each $i\in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, $j\in \{1,2\}$ and $\ell \leq (i-1)$, 
we now define an execution of the form  $\mathbb{E}_{j\ell}^{i}=\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha_j^i$
as follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
%$\rho^m$ is defined as above;
$\beta^{\ell}$ is the t-complete step contention-free execution fragment of a fast-path transaction $T_{\ell}$
that writes $nv_{\ell}\neq v$ to $X_{\ell}$ and commits
\item
$\alpha_1^i$ (and resp. $\alpha_2^i$) is the complete step contention-free execution fragment of 
$\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow v$ (and resp. $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow A_{\phi}$).
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{claim}
\label{cl:ic2}
For all $i\in \{2,\ldots, m\}$ and $\ell \leq (i-1)$, $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\mathbb{E}_{1\ell}^{i}$ or 
$\mathbb{E}_{2\ell}^{i}$.
\end{claim}
%
% \begin{proof}
% %
% For all $i \in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, $\pi^{i-1}$
% is an execution of $\mathcal{M}$.
% By assumption of invisible reads, $T_{{\ell}}$ must be committed in $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \rho^{\ell}$
% and $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}$.
% By the same reasoning, since $T_i$ and $T_{\ell}$ do not have conflicting data sets,
% $\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$.
% 
% Since the configuration after $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$ is quiescent,
% $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$ extended with $\Read_{\phi}(X_i)$
% must return a matching response.
% If $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow v_i$, then clearly $\mathbb{E}_{1}^{i}$
% is an execution of $M$ with $T_{\phi}, T_{i-1}, T_i$ being a valid serialization
% of transactions.
% If $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow A_{\phi}$, the same serialization
% justifies an opaque execution.
% 
% Suppose by contradiction that there exists an execution of $\mathcal{M}$ such that
% $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i$ is extended with the complete execution
% of $\Read_{\phi}(X_i) \rightarrow r$; $r \not\in \{A_{\phi},v\}$. 
% The only plausible case to analyse is when $r=nv$.
% Since $\Read_{\phi}(X_i)$ returns the value of $X_i$ updated by $T_i$, 
% the only possible serialization for transactions is $T_{\ell}$, $T_i$, $T_{\phi}$; but $\Read_{\phi}(X_{\ell})$
% performed by $T_k$ that returns the initial value $v$
% is not legal in this serialization---contradiction.
% \end{proof}
%
%
For all $i\in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, $j\in \{1,2\}$ and $\ell \leq (i-1)$, slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ must access
$(i-1)$ different base objects during the execution of $\Read_{\phi}(X_i)$ in the execution
$\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \alpha_j^i$.

Consider the $(i-1)$ different executions: 
$\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{1}\cdot \rho^i$, $\ldots$, $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i$ (cf. Figure~\ref{sfig:inv-3}).
For all $\ell, \ell' \leq (i-1)$;$\ell' \neq \ell$, 
$\mathcal{M}$ has an execution of the form $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell}\cdot \rho^i \cdot \beta^{\ell'}$
in which transactions $T_{\ell}$ and $T_{\ell'}$ access mutually disjoint data sets.
By invisible reads and Lemma~\ref{lm:hytm}, the pairs of transactions $T_{\ell'}$, $T_{i}$ and $T_{\ell'}$, $T_{\ell}$
do not contend on any base object in this execution.
This implies that $\pi^{i-1}\cdot \beta^{\ell} \cdot \beta^{\ell'} \cdot \rho^i$ is an execution of $\mathcal{M}$ in which
transactions $T_{\ell}$ and $T_{\ell'}$ each apply nontrivial primitives
to mutually disjoint sets of base objects in the execution fragments $\beta^{\ell}$ and $\beta^{\ell'}$ respectively.

This implies that for any $j\in \{1,2\}$, $\ell \leq (i-1)$, the configuration $C^i$ after $E^i$ differs from the configurations
after $\mathbb{E}_{j\ell}^{i}$ only in the states of the base objects that are accessed in the fragment $\beta^{\ell}$.
Consequently, transaction $T_{\phi}$ must access at least $i-1$ different base objects
in the execution fragment $\pi_j^i$
to distinguish configuration $C^i$ from the configurations
that result after the $(i-1)$ different executions 
$\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{1}\cdot \rho^i$, $\ldots$, $\pi^{i-1}\cdot\beta^{i-1}\cdot \rho^i$ respectively.

Thus, for all $i \in \{2,\ldots, m\}$, slow-path transaction $T_{\phi}$ must perform at least $i-1$ steps 
while executing the $i^{th}$ t-read in $\pi_{j}^i$.
\end{proof}
