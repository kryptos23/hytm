\begin{theorem}
\label{th:impossibility}
There does not exist any progressive opaque HyTM implementation $\mathcal{M}$ with invisible reads such that in every execution $E$ of $\mathcal{M}$, any t-read operation $op_k$ performed by some slow-path transaction $T_k \in \ms{txns}(E)$
performs $O(1)$ steps.
